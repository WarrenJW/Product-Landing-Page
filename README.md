# Product-Landing-Page

This is my Product Landing Page. I'll be following the instructions provided for this T.O.P challenge whilst also implementing some personalisation. 

My aim was to replicate the style of layout provided by T.O.P but to add my own theme to make it more challenging but at the same time more appealing.

The theme is based on a fan made unofficial website for my home town football club, Wrexham AFC.

Upon completion of this project I feel my knowledge of CSS has become a lot better and I have become comfortable in applying it. With the help of the information I've learnt, the documentation provided and some googling I have managed to make a page that I am pleased with as a amateur coder. I enjoyed the creativity and found myself immersed in the project. I look forward to the next project!
